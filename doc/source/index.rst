Welcome to PyOpenCL's documentation!
====================================

PyOpenCL gives you easy, Pythonic access to the `OpenCL
<http://www.khronos.org/opencl/>`_ parallel computation API.
What makes PyOpenCL special?

* Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom,
  often called 
  `RAII <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization>`_
  in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and
  crash-free code. PyOpenCL knows about dependencies, too, so (for example)
  it won't detach from a context before all memory allocated in it is also
  freed.

* Completeness. PyOpenCL puts the full power of OpenCL's API at your
  disposal, if you wish.

* Automatic Error Checking. All errors are automatically translated
  into Python exceptions.

* Speed. PyOpenCL's base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties above
  are virtually free.

* Helpful Documentation. You're looking at it. ;)

* Liberal license. PyOpenCL is open-source and free for commercial, 
  academic, and private use.

Note that this guide does not explain OpenCL programming and technology. Please 
refer to generic OpenCL tutorials for that.

PyOpenCL also has its own `web site <http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl>`_,
where you can find updates, new versions, documentation, and support.
